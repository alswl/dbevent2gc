        About this fork which is not a fork anymore
        ===========================================
        
        Aim of this fork was to bring this package up to date with latest icalendar
        `RFC`_ specification as part of `plone.app.event`_ project which goal is to
        bring recurrent evens to `Plone`_.
        
        After some thoughts we (Plone developers involved with `plone.app.event`_) send
        a suggestion to icalendar-dev@codespeak.net to take owner the maintanancea.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        2.2 - unreleased
        ----------------
        
        * migration to https://github.com/collective/icalendar using svn2git preserving
        tags, branches and authors.
        [garbas]
        
        * using tox for testing on python 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.6.
        [garbas]
        
        * fixed tests so they pass also under python 2.7.
        [garbas]
        
        * running tests on https://jenkins.plone.org/job/icalendar (only 2.6 for now)
        with some other metrics (pylint, clonedigger, coverage).
        [garbas]
        
        * review and merge changes from https://github.com/cozi/icalendar fork.
        [garbas]
        
        * created sphinx documentation and started documenting development and goals.
        [garbas]
        
        * hook out github repository to http://readthedocs.org service so sphinx
        documentation is generated on each commit (for master). Documentation can be
        visible on: http://readthedocs.org/docs/icalendar/en/latest/

        2.1 (2009-12-14)
        ----------------
        
        * Fix deprecation warnings about ``object.__init__`` taking no parameters.
        
        * Set the VALUE parameter correctly for date values.
        
        * Long binary data would be base64 encoded with newlines, which made the
        iCalendar files incorrect. (This still needs testing).
        
        * Correctly handle content lines which include newlines.
        
        
        2.0.1 (2008-07-11)
        ------------------
        
        * Made the tests run under Python 2.5+
        
        * Renamed the UTC class to Utc, so it would not clash with the UTC object,
        since that rendered the UTC object unpicklable.
        
        
        2.0 (2008-07-11)
        ----------------
        
        * EXDATE and RDATE now returns a vDDDLists object, which contains a list
        of vDDDTypes objects. This is do that EXDATE and RDATE can contain
        lists of dates, as per RFC.
        
        ***Note!***: This change is incompatible with earlier behavior, so if you
        handle EXDATE and RDATE you will need to update your code.
        
        * When createing a vDuration of -5 hours (which in itself is nonsensical),
        the ical output of that was -P1DT19H, which is correct, but ugly. Now
        it's '-PT5H', which is prettier.
        
        
        1.2 (2006-11-25)
        ----------------
        
        * Fixed a string index out of range error in the new folding code.
        
        
        1.1 (2006-11-23)
        ----------------
        
        * Fixed a bug in caselessdicts popitem. (thanks to Michael Smith
        <msmith@fluendo.com>)
        
        * The RFC 2445 was a bit unclear on how to handle line folding when it
        happened to be in the middle of a UTF-8 character. This has been clarified
        in the following discussion: http://lists.osafoundation.org/pipermail/ietf-calsify/2006-August/001126.html
        And this is now implemented in iCalendar. It will not fold in the middle of
        a UTF-8 character, but may fold in the middle of a UTF-8 composing character
        sequence.
        
        
        1.0 (2006-08-03)
        ----------------
        
        * make get_inline and set_inline support non ascii codes.
        
        * Added support for creating a python egg distribution.
        
        
        0.11 (2005-11-08)
        -----------------
        
        * Changed component .from_string to use types_factory instead of hardcoding
        entries to 'inline'
        
        * Changed UTC tzinfo to a singleton so the same one is used everywhere
        
        * Made the parser more strict by using regular expressions for key name,
        param name and quoted/unquoted safe char as per the RFC
        
        * Added some tests from the schooltool icalendar parser for better coverage
        
        * Be more forgiving on the regex for folding lines
        
        * Allow for multiple top-level components on .from_string
        
        * Fix vWeekdays, wasn't accepting relative param (eg: -3SA vs -SA)
        
        * vDDDTypes didn't accept negative period (eg: -P30M)
        
        * 'N' is also acceptable as newline on content lines, per RFC
        
        
        0.10 (2005-04-28)
        -----------------
        
        * moved code to codespeak.net subversion.
        
        * reorganized package structure so that source code is under 'src' directory.
        Non-package files remain in distribution root.
        
        * redid doc/.py files as doc/.txt, using more modern doctest. Before they
        were .py files with big docstrings.
        
        * added test.py testrunner, and tests/test_icalendar.py that picks up all
        doctests in source code and doc directory, and runs them, when typing::
        
        python2.3 test.py
        
        * renamed iCalendar to lower case package name, lowercased, de-pluralized and
        shorted module names, which are mostly implementation detail.
        
        * changed tests so they generate .ics files in a temp directory, not in the structure itself.
